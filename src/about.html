    <h1>About Dream Demon</h1>

    <video src="assets/videos/glow_eyes_01.mp4" autoplay muted loop></video>

    <p>This project was inspired by a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dreamdemonhouse/" target="_blank">physical art
        installation</a> at Bombay Beach created by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/takenbyamelody_/"
        target="_blank">Melody Sample</a>. During
      our 3 month residency at <a href="https://mars.college/" target="_blank">Mars College</a> we visited the location many times. It is an abandoned house that
      is decorated with wires, dry branches,
      drawings, notes and many other elements. There is a spiritual ambience and it is a unique experience to be present in this space, especially
      at night.</p>

    <p>
      This Web experience started as my desire to explore a PBR material workflow and play with Blender and Houdini
      modeling tools, as well as Substance Painter. I started with modeling a chair and creating some textures for it.
      Then I used Houdini Lab Tree Generator to quickly create branches that ended up looking quite similar to the one
      in the house.
    </p>

    <img src="assets/imgs/chair.jpg" />

    <p>
      I also modeled and textured a few other objects from the real scene such as the disc hanging on the wall behind the
      chair.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just to have a feel for the scene I decided to assemble it in Unreal Engine. Which ended up looking pretty cool
      with PBR materials and volumetric lighting.
    </p>

    <p>At this point I showed my scene to Snay and she got excited to spice it up with some shader magic and her
      new simulation that she had been building in Houdini (tentacles/wires escaping from the insides of a girl spirit).</p>

    <p>
      After a few brain storming sessions, we came up with an idea to transition the whole scene to an alternate dark void that the spirit inhabits, with a dark shadow propagation effect that Snay made.
       We also decided on a scrolling interaction for the scene to allow for more cinematic movement.
      I decided to make final scene assembly in Blender since it has a superior GLTF Exporter compared to Houdini. It was
      great because I can easily create an animation track for the camera and multiple animation clips for the rigged
      character and export it to ThreeJS.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is annoyingly hard to export models from Blender since you need to go through the process of selecting a target
      object, going to <code>File > Export > GLTF...</code>, setting export settings, finding output folder, ugh... I ended up
      writing <a href="https://gist.github.com/Kif11/8d2bdcdaf4a90f8839e0a86178d4046e" target="_blank">a script</a>
      that saved me a lot of manual labour.
      This also has a benefit of applying Draco mesh compression and KTX2 texture compression automatically.
      The Blender and PBR workflow allows me to preview scenes directly in the editor, which after some tweaks look pretty
      close to the scene in the browser.

    <h2>Entity Component System</h2>

    <p>
      It just happened that at the same time I was trying to find a better tool then A-Frame for managing ThreeJS scenes
      in a
      sane way.
      Not to say that A-Frame is a bad tool but it has it's own quirks when you move beyond a scene with one spinning cube that we spent
      many hours trying to work
      around or optimize. Also I wanted to utilize Type Script (amazing) with the community written types for Three JS.
      However due to
      some high level shenanigans with imports it was impossible to set up in A-Frame. These A-Frame included imports also cause the final build size
      to be 1.5 MB larger.
    </p>

    <p>
      I decided to write my own ECS library to address some of those issues, and this was the first project that we tested it on.
      Despite being quite a thin layer on top of ThreeJS, it allows us to organize the scene and separate logic for
      different effects as well as deal with asynchronous loading of assets in a straightforward way.
      You can check the code for entire project on <a href="https://github.com/codercatclub/dream-demon"

    </p>

    <h2>Wires</h2>

    <p>I am not sure how Melody made those cool wires but it was definitely tricky to make and I spent a day playing
      with
      Houdini Vellum solver and custom VEX code. The effect was based on <a href="https://entagma.com/"
        target="_blank">Entagma</a> sticky wires tutorial which I cannot find anymore. I made an HDA from it so you can check it out <a
        href="https://github.com/Kif11/houdini/blob/master/hda/kif_sticky_wires.hda" target="_blank">here.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      The base structure for Vellum simulation was made in a loop that connects nearest point of the arc to house
      support beams in a random fashion.
    </p>

    <h2>Fin</h2>
    <p class="end">
      Overall this was a typical Codercat endeavor, with many of our current interests merging into one strange piece.
      We are excited that we finally made a project using textures and more realism, but it may be the last one ;)
